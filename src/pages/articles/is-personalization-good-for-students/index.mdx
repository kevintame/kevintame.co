For many years, I've been deeply intrigued by the concept of personalization. As a user of technology I've often seen it as a groundbreaking advancement, tailor-made to enhance my own experience on the web. 
However, over time, my perspective has shifted, and I've grown increasingly skeptical about its role in making us better, more connected humans.

As social creatures, our innate desire to connect with other and feel like we matter and belong is fundamental. 
Yet, in this era where social media reigns supreme and algorithms feed us personalized content, 
I can't help but feel that personalization is paradoxically leading us towards greater social disconnection.
Never in the history of the world are we more connected to one another, whilte at the same time feeling more disconneted.

Let's take a trip back to the 1950s for a moment. 
Picture a time when neighbors likely attended the same school, worshipped at the same church, watched the same three TV stations, and shopped at the same local grocery store. 
The absence of personalization meant more shared experiences, forging stronger communal bonds. 
I can almost hear a group of workers by the water cooler, discussing the latest bit on the Ed Sullivan Show - a shared cultural moment.

> Did you see the game last night?
>
> Wasn't that show funny?
>
> Did you hear the union is negotiating our contract for higher wages?

Honest question... does water cooler talk even exist any more?

Fast forward to our present, hyper-personalized world, and the contrast is stark. We have very few shared experience. 
Our experiences have become so individualized that shared moments are rare.
If I were to ask my friends about the media they consumed last night, chances are each would mention something different, something unique to their personalized Netflix recommendations.
Where would I even have the conversation? Via text, DMs, or on someone's social media feed?

In 2011 I was teaching Algebra 1 and there was this massive desire to flip the classroom. 
The idea was to let students go at thier own pace by watching and learning at home and them coming to class to get reinforced on the things they learned.
This personalized learning experiece was all the rage and fueled by the argument that personalization created a better education experince. 
Unfortunatly, that year I saw some of my weakest gains in student outcomes. 
There are obviously many factors that most likely contributed to these weak outcomes that I can't chaulk up to this new way of teaching. 
Education has for centuries been a collective journey, a communal rite of passage that lays a common foundation for us all. 
But in our current landscape, where personalization is king, I often wonder: is education truly better as a highly personalized endeavor rather than a shared experience?

In sharing these thoughts, my intention isn't to outright condemn personalization. 
Instead, I aim to spark a conversation about its impact on our social fabric. 
While personalization undoubtedly offers individualized experiences, it may also be diminishing the common ground that binds communities together. 
As we navigate this digital age, it's crucial to reflect on how we can maintain a sense of community and shared understanding amidst an increasingly personalized world.

In 2011, as an Algebra 1 teacher, I witnessed firsthand the burgeoning trend of 'flipping the classroom.' 
The concept was innovative: allow students to learn at their own pace by engaging with material at home, and then use classroom time for reinforcing what they'd absorbed. 
This approach was a nod to the growing preference for personalized learning experiences, bolstered by arguments that personalization could revolutionize education.
However, that academic year, I observed some of the most modest gains in student outcomes in my short teaching career. 
While there were undoubtedly multiple factors influencing these results, the experience led me to question the efficacy of this new teaching method. 
Education, for centuries, has been a collective journey, a shared rite of passage that establishes a common baseline of knowledge and experience. 
I sometimes her personalization regarded as the ultimate educational strategy, and I find myself pondering a critical question: Is the path to educational excellence really through highly personalized methods, or do we risk losing something fundamental in the shift away from shared learning experiences?

Ultiamtly, I really don't know, and I often lean towards a balanced approach to change.
 
## Final Thoughts
My intention for this post is not to vilify personalization. 
Rather, I want to initiate a dialogue about its broader implications. 
Personalization, without a doubt, offers tailor-made experiences, potentially enriching learning and engagement on an individual level. 
Yet, I see the concern that it might also be eroding the socail and communial foundation that is crucial for a cohesive society. 
In a world increasingly tailored to individual tastes and preferences, the challenge we all face is balancing personalization with the need for common experiences and understandings. 

As we continue to live in this new digital langscape, it becomes increasingly important for us to contemplate how we can cultivate a sense of community, shared values, and collective understanding, even as our world becomes more personalized. 
How we address this balance could define the social fabric of our future.
